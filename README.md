<h1>Weather Project Code</h1>

<h2>Weather Project App</h2>
<p>
  This is a weather app which gathers corresponding weather information using an API from https://openweathermap.org/.
</p>

<p>
  This is a weather app project using Node.js and Express.js with Heroku server. This uses an API to gather relevant weather information for a city that the user inputs. This returns the weather description, temperature, and a corresponding image of the current weather at that specific time for that specific location. The main focus of this project is back-end development.

<h3>Env</h3>

<p>
  Note the .env_sample file example of using open weather API_KEY. This uses dotenv to store the personal API as process in code. More info can be found here about dotenv: https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv
</p>

<p>
  You will need to create a new .env file for your personal API_KEY. This is where you will store the variable which will be used in the app code.
